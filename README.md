# Specific use case dependency resolver

A simple framework for resolving dependencies in code and managing a mapping of
configurations to determine how specific dependencies should be resolved.

This isn't optimal and there are likely better implementations out there, but
I needed something very quickly for a few specific, temporary, use cases. So
it may not be very useful in general.
